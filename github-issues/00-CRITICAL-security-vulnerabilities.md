## ✅ FIXED: Next.js Remote Code Execution

### Resolution
The critical Next.js RCE vulnerability has been patched by upgrading to **Next.js 16.0.10**.

### Original Vulnerability Details
- **Package**: `next@16.0.3` → **Fixed in 16.0.10**
- **CVE**: CVE-2025-66478
- **Advisory**: [GHSA-9qr9-h5gf-34mp](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-9qr9-h5gf-34mp)
- **CWE**: CWE-502 (Deserialization of Untrusted Data)
- **Affects**: Next.js 16.x App Router, React Server Components

### Attack Vector (No longer applicable)
- Network accessible (AV:N)
- Low attack complexity (AC:L)
- No privileges required (PR:N)
- No user interaction needed (UI:N)

### Fix Applied
```bash
# Already applied - Next.js upgraded to 16.0.10
pnpm update next@16.0.10
```

### Risk to Talk-To-My-Lawyer
- ✅ **Production deployment affected**
- ✅ Payment processing endpoints vulnerable
- ✅ User data (PII, legal information) at risk
- ✅ Database access could be compromised
- ✅ Stripe API keys could be exposed

**This is a deploy blocker. Do not push to production until fixed.**

## 🟠 HIGH #2: path-to-regexp ReDoS

### Impact
**CVSS 7.5** - Regular Expression Denial of Service can block Node.js event loop, making application unresponsive.

### Vulnerability Details
- **Package**: `path-to-regexp@6.2.1` (via `@vercel/node`)
- **CVE**: CVE-2024-45296
- **CWE**: CWE-1333 (Inefficient Regular Expression)

### Attack Example
```javascript
// Malicious URL with 8000 repetitions
GET /a-a-a-a-a-a-a... (8000 times) /a
// Causes ~600ms latency vs normal 1ms
// With concurrent requests, can DoS the server
```

### Fix
```bash
pnpm update @vercel/node
```

This will upgrade transitive dependency `path-to-regexp` to >= 6.3.0

## 🟠 HIGH #3 & #4: MCP SDK DNS Rebinding (2 instances)

### Impact
Malicious websites can bypass same-origin policy and send requests to local MCP servers running on localhost.

### Vulnerability Details
- **CVE**: CVE-2025-66414
- **CWE**: CWE-350 (Reliance on Reverse DNS), CWE-1188 (Insecure Default)
- **Affected Packages**:
  1. `@modelcontextprotocol/server-filesystem@*` → sdk@1.23.0
  2. `@mzxrai/mcp-webresearch@*` → sdk@1.0.1

### Attack Scenario
1. User runs MCP server locally (development)
2. User visits malicious website
3. Attacker uses DNS rebinding to access `http://127.0.0.1:<port>`
4. Attacker invokes tools/resources as the user

### Fix
```bash
pnpm update @modelcontextprotocol/server-filesystem
pnpm update @mzxrai/mcp-webresearch
```

**Note**: Only affects development environments with local MCP servers.

## 🟡 MODERATE #5: esbuild CORS Vulnerability

### Impact
**CVSS 5.3** - Development server allows any website to read source code and source maps.

### Vulnerability Details
- **Package**: `esbuild@0.14.47` (via `@vercel/node`)
- **Advisory**: [GHSA-67mh-4wv8-2f99](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-67mh-4wv8-2f99)
- **CWE**: CWE-346 (Origin Validation Error)

### Attack Scenario
Developer runs `pnpm dev` → visits malicious site → attacker fetches:
- Source code (`/app.js`)
- Source maps (exposes original TypeScript)
- Environment variables in code
- API endpoints and business logic

### Fix
```bash
pnpm update @vercel/node
```

**Note**: Only affects **development** environment, not production.

## Quick Fix - Run All Updates

```bash
# 1. Fix CRITICAL Next.js RCE
pnpm update next@16.0.7

# 2. Fix HIGH + MODERATE @vercel/node issues
pnpm update @vercel/node

# 3. Fix HIGH MCP SDK vulnerabilities
pnpm update @modelcontextprotocol/server-filesystem @mzxrai/mcp-webresearch

# 4. Verify fixes
pnpm audit

# 5. Test application
pnpm dev
# ... test critical flows ...

# 6. Build for production
pnpm build

# 7. Deploy immediately
```

---

## Verification

After applying fixes, verify vulnerabilities are resolved:

```bash
# Should show 0 vulnerabilities
pnpm audit

# Check specific package versions
pnpm list next @vercel/node @modelcontextprotocol/sdk
```

Expected versions after fix:
- `next@16.0.7` ✅
- `@vercel/node@latest` (with path-to-regexp >= 6.3.0, esbuild >= 0.25.0)
- `@modelcontextprotocol/sdk@1.24.0+`

## Long-term Prevention

### 1. Pin Package Versions
Replace `"latest"` with specific versions in `package.json`:

```json
{
  "dependencies": {
    "@supabase/supabase-js": "^2.50.0",  // instead of "latest"
    "next-themes": "^0.2.1",  // instead of "latest"
    "date-fns": "^3.0.0"  // instead of "latest"
  }
}
```

### 2. Automated Security Scanning

Add to `.github/workflows/security.yml`:
```yaml
name: Security Audit
on: [push, pull_request]
jobs:
  audit:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4
      - uses: pnpm/action-setup@v2
      - run: pnpm install
      - run: pnpm audit --audit-level=moderate
```

### 3. Dependabot Configuration

Create `.github/dependabot.yml`:
```yaml
version: 2
updates:
  - package-ecosystem: "npm"
    directory: "/"
    schedule:
      interval: "weekly"
    open-pull-requests-limit: 10
    labels:
      - "dependencies"
      - "security"
```

### 4. Pre-commit Hook

Add to `package.json`:
```json
{
  "scripts": {
    "preinstall": "pnpm audit --audit-level=high"
  }
}
```

### 5. Regular Audits
```bash
# Weekly security audit
pnpm audit

# Update all non-breaking dependencies
pnpm update

# Update with breaking changes (review carefully)
pnpm update --latest
```
